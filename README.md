- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
  - All kinds of backends for The Linux Foundation Insights V2 and V3 project
  - I'm an author & maintainer of CNCF's DevStats tool.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
  - I'm learning mostly go, RedShift & Cube.js atm.
  - Also researching Rust in my spare time
  - When speaking about non-developer hobbies:
    - I'm currently researching [deep ultraviolet photography](https://www.ultravioletphotography.com/content/index.php?/profile/368-lukaszgryglicki/).
    - I also enjoy other EM spectra photography - infrared (up to 1.2um, then thermal 7.5-14um), ultraviolet 250nm - 360nm (even UV-B & UV-C).
    - I like lasers too (have 808nm IR 7W and 445nm 4W AC powered, dream about portable CO2 > 20W).
    - I like analog photography and also modern one - but it needs to be >= full frame (mostly using medium format (GFX, P67) recently).
    - Enjoying motorbikes and old cars (like BMW E38 V12, Audi A8 D2 V8 etc.).
    - Traveling North, especially above the Arctic Circle (Norway is my favorite, especially Spitsbergen), also Alaska, Canada, used to like Russia but no longer like it (I think it's clear why).
- I think I should be a scientist, but doing something quite close to it.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
  - Photography, especially invisible "light", photograhic lenses.
  - Old cars.
  - Lasers.
  - Traveling far and without any travel agencies (traveled entire Russia once - not using planes, in the Siberian winter...).
